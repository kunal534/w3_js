<!-- 
 
Here i have attached the funciton with paranthesis which means i am explicitly calling the function
due to which when we click the button the print option comes in that moment

but if i haven't used paranthesis then it would mean passing the value by reference which are used in even handler 
such as settimeout(fun_name,2000)
